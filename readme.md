#twitterTestApp

This is just a simple (test) laravel app that allows a user to register / login and then link her twitter account to her account on the app.

The app allows the user to create a simple profile `profile/create` on the app (name, country and address). Currently the app doesnâ€™t support editing the profile after creating it (it just needs some form model binding to make it editable).

The app also show the user twitter profile, the `/twitter` route:

 - The first part (named twitter) is retrieved from the DB, these information are retrieved via the Twitter API and persisted on the DB. 
 - The second part showcases how we can use twitter API, in this case we retrieve the user profile via the twitter API.
 
#How to use the app

Firstly, you need to create a twitter app from here:
https://apps.twitter.com/app/new

get the **access token** and the **Access Token Secret** and update the .env file:

    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=[put twitter consumer here]
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=[put twitter consumer  secret here]

you need of course to set up a database as well:

    DB_DATABASE=homestead
    DB_USERNAME=homestead
    DB_PASSWORD=secret

after that, all what you need to do, it to execute:

    php artisan serve

and you are good to go.
the app will be available here: http://localhost:8000/
